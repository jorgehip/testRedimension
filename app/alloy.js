When wires are poorly connected they overheat, which creates a potential fire hazard.  The presence of aluminum wiring might also have an effect on your insurance policy.

Connections in outlets, switches, and light fixtures with aluminum wiring may become increasingly dangerous as time passes. Poor connections cause wiring to overheat, creating a potential fire hazard. Aluminum wiring connections are subject to greater deterioration than is copper due to thermal expansion and contraction, vibration (caused when electric currents pass through wiring), oxidation (caused by exposure to oxygen in the air), and galvanic corrosion (caused when two different metals are connected together), all of which can cause poor connections. When wires are poorly connected they overheat, which creates a potential fire hazard.  The presence of aluminum wiring might also have an effect on your insurance policy. You should ask your insurance agent whether the presence of aluminum wiring is a problem that requires changes to your policy language in order to ensure that your house is covered.

Connections in outlets, switches, and light fixtures with aluminum wiring may become increasingly dangerous as time passes. Poor connections cause wiring to overheat, creating a potential fire hazard. Aluminum wiring connections are subject to greater deterioration than is copper due to thermal expansion and contraction, vibration (caused when electric currents pass through wiring), oxidation (caused by exposure to oxygen in the air), and galvanic corrosion (caused when two different metals are connected together), all of which can cause poor connections. When wires are poorly connected they overheat, which creates a potential fire hazard.  The presence of aluminum wiring might also have an effect on your insurance policy. You should ask your insurance agent whether the presence of aluminum wiring is a problem that requires changes to your policy language in order to ensure that your house is covered.
